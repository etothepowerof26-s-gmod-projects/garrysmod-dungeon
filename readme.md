# Garry's Mod Dungeon

Side project that I've attempted to revive.

Uses bad coding practices that are probably (not) gonna get rewritten soon as of 2/16/21

Pulls things from:
- Bosses/enemies: Vindictus, Dark Messiah. Those models aren't mine
- Health bar/damage indicators: CapsAdmin's JRPG healthbar system (link in the file)
- Any other player stats/misc ideas: Sadly, Hypixel Skyblock
